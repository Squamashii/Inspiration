# Inspiration
This is a file where I will write down things that inspire or motivate me, things that make me smile, or things I just think are pure awesomeness. (Edit>>) This is actually going to be a huge work in progress, if I ever take the time to make this into something useful for myself.

Ok, First off, I am going to make a short list of things that make me smile:
1. Emma. She is my beautiful girlfriend, and I love just about everything about her. She has a beautiful voice, and I love hearing her pray and read, and just talk. I still can't get her to sing very loud. I get accused of smiling all the time when I'm around her.
2. My bird. I have a lovebird named Tiger.
  Tiger can recognize my voice, and he comes to the edge of his cage to see me when he hears me.
3. When little nieces and nephews come up and give me a hug out of nowhere. Actually, little kids do a lot that makes me smile. But I like it best when they are happy.

Where do I want to be in the year 2030?
  - I hope to be graduating from the Animation and Game Design program at UVU in the year 2030. That means I will be 30 years old! gaah!
  - I would like to have 5 to 10 properties under contract with the real estate traniing I have been going through. 

Random list of motivations:
1. I am self-motivated to succeed.
2. I live a little bit in the future, and am trying to stay in the present.


Pure Awesomeness list:
1. Mangoes
2. 
3. 
4. 
5.

# Inspiration
This is a file where I will write down things that inspire or motivate me, things that make me smile, or things I just think are pure awesomeness

Ok, First off, I am going to make a short list of things that make me smile:
1. Emma.
2. My bird. I have a lovebird named Tiger.
  Tiger can recognize my voice, and he comes to the edge of his cage to see me when he hears me.
3. When little nieces and nephews come up and give me a hug out of nowhere.

Pure Awesomeness list:
1. Mangoes
2. 
3. 
4. 
5.
